# Financial-Performance-Analysis-Project
Project Overview:

This project is an end-to-end FP&A analytics case study designed to simulate real-world financial planning and analysis workflows.
The goal was to analyze financial performance, build key financial KPIs, perform budget vs actual analysis, and visualize insights using Power BI.
The project covers data extraction, data cleaning, KPI calculation, budgeting logic, and executive-level dashboarding.

Business Problem:

Raw financial data is often messy, inconsistent, and not analysis-ready, making reporting slow and error-prone.

Finance teams need a single source of truth to:
1.Track financial performance across products and regions
2.Monitor profitability, cash flow, and working capital
3.Compare Actual vs Budgeted Net Sales
4.Support monthly management reporting and decision-making

Key Highlights:

Cleaned and transformed 3 years of monthly financial data using Python

Built core FP&A KPIs: Net Sales, Gross Margin, EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Working Capital

Created Budget vs Actual analysis with variance tracking

Designed a executive Power BI dashboard for decision-making

Outcome:

Delivered a structured FP&A reporting model that improves financial visibility across products, regions, and time periods, similar to management dashboards
